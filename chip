{=(r3):**Why are there multiple bots?**\n\nDiscord does not allow bots to join more than one voice channel in a server, so to help people listen to different things in the same server we have multiple bots.\n\n> You can invite them using the links:\n> **[Chip `ch!`](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=614109280508968980&scope=bot&permissions=8)**\n> **[Chip 2 `cp!`](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=679643572814741522&scope=bot&permissions=8)**\n> **[Chip 3 `ci!`](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=634695585508884505&scope=bot&permissions=8)**}
{=(r4):**How to only allow the bot to work in certain text channels**\nTo restrict the bot to certain channels, we use the built in permission system on Discord!\n\n1️⃣ **Make sure none of Chip's Role(s) give it the Administrator Permissions**\nIf a user has Administrator, all other permissions are ignored.\n\n2️⃣ **Remove Read Messages Permissions from the channels you would not like it to respond in**\nGo to the channel settings, and decline the Chip Bot / Role the permissions `Read Messages` in the channels you would not like it in.}

{=(r8):**I cannot hear Chip!**\n\n`1.` Look above your username (with the mute/deafen/settings icons) - does it say `Voice Connected`? If not, check your internet connection. If it says RTC connecting, consider downloading the Discord desktop client, or try another web browser.\n\n`2.` Check you're not deafened or server deafened.\n\n`3.` Ensure the bot is not client/server muted by right clicking it, and make sure the volume is up in the same place.\n\n`4.`Make sure something is playing using `ch!np` and the bot is not paused using `ch!resume`.\n\n`5.` Make sure your Sound Settings are correct. *(*`User Settings` --> `Voice & Video` --> `Ensure the Output and Input Devices are not set to Default, and are your correct Sound Devices`*)*  }
