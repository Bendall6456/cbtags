{=(r16):üìã **How do I use the menu?**\nTo edit your menu, you do `!menu list` to see the available items. \nThen you choose them by doing `!menu edit [number of the menu slot] [number of the item]`\n> Eg: If you wanted to add beef taquitos to your second menu slot, you would do `!menu edit 2 11`. With 2 for the slot number and 11 for the food item.\n\nWhen your income increases, you unlock new menu slots which increase your hourly income.\n\n```Slot 1 at $0 income, gives +$150 income\nSlot 2 at $500 income, gives +$200 income\nSlot 3 at $1000 income, gives +$250 income\nSlot 4 at $2500 income, gives +$300 income\nSlot 5 at $5000 income, gives +$350 income\nSlot 6 at $7500 income, gives +$400 income\nSlot 7 at $10000 income, gives +$450 income\nSlot 8 at $15000 income, gives +$500 income```\nThose slots can be filled with **any item on the menu**, but each slot has an income increase set, which means **the chosen item will not affect your income.** It is just to add your favorite foods to personalize your shack!\nThere is a maximum of **8 slots**.}
{=(r17):üíØ **Max Income**\nThe way you get max income is by doing all `!upgrades`, `!hire`, `!ads`, `!deco`, expanding your shack, then getting all 8 menu slots, getting to Level 30 and being in a Level 20 franchise. \n\n**Most people who have everything maxed but level still have different incomes though. **\n\nThis is because of different versions of the bot over the past 2 years. There will be an income overhaul coming that will correct people's incomes. Currently most people are over what their max income should be.}
{=(r18):{coinemote} **How do the register and tip-jar channels work?**\nIn <#529044262248251422>, the customer wants to purchase tacos every **3 to 8 minutes** and the **first** person to type `sell` gets to sell their tacos and earn the money.\n\nIn <#498614068450689035>, the customer gives letters to unscramble and the **first** person to find the right word and to type it in the channel will earn the tip. \nThe words are usually food-related, so `mile` would be unscrambled to make `lime` even if mile is a word, the right answer is lime.\n\n`There is slowmode enabled in these channels to prevent one individual from taking all the tips. That way, more people have a fair chance at playing those mini-games. We do not plan to remove or reduce that cooldown.`}
{=(r19):‚õî **How to only allow the bot to work in certain channels**\nTo restrict the bot to certain channels, we use the built in permission system on Discord!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **Make sure none of TacoShack's Role(s) give it the Administrator Permissions**\n> If a user has Administrator, all other permissions are ignored.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **Remove Read Messages Permissions from the channels you would not like it to respond in**\n> Go to the channel settings, and decline the TacoShack Bot / Role the permissions `Read Messages` in the channels you would not like it in.}
{=(r20):üõ† **What is the !s command?**\nThis command is simply for Developers to see if the bot is responding / working correctly, and sometimes used as a troubleshooting step for users. It has nothing to do with gameplay.}
{=(r21):üåÆ **Tacos are simply an indicator of how much you've worked**\nSell more by doing `!work` every 10 minute *(or less depending on donation)* or `!overtime` every 30 minutes if you're in a franchise.\nYou can compete for the `!leaderboard` and `!lb global` for most tacos sold!}

{=(r23):üîó **Frequently Asked Questions**\n> You can read the FAQ's for the bot/server [here](https://tacoshack.dev/faq/).}
{=(r24):üñ•Ô∏è **Sharding**\nDue to how large discord bots can grow, it is necessary to implement a load balancing system to spread the load across multiple instances, and so the Discord Team implemented a method for this called Sharding.\n\nIt essentially splits up a bot into multiple portions and thus evens out the load.\nHowever, because of this a bot can be offline in one server but online in another.\n\n> For more detailed information please [click here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding).}
{=(r25):üîß **Troubleshooting the bot not responding**\n> A shard may be just rebooting, so please always wait a minute or two for it to come back online, you can use the command `!s` to check if it is online\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **Are you using the correct prefix?**\n> The default prefix is `!`, but it may have been changed in your server. You can use the command `!prefixinfo` to check if it has been changed (this command always responds, regardless of if it has actually changed).\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **Does the bot have the correct permissions for the channel?**\n> The bot needs the following permissions to function:\n```Read Messages\nSend Messages\nManage Messages\nEmbed Links\nRead Message History\nUse External Emojis\nAdd Reactions```\n\nPlease double check these permissions were not updated if the bot was responding before.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ **Contact Support Again**\n> If this is all correct, it is likely there is an issue with the bot. You can check <#496046802722881549> for a status to see if we are aware.}
