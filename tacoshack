{=(r1):**Change Prefix:**\nTo update the bot's prefix use `!prefix newprefix`, for example `!prefix t!`.

{=(r4):**🧾 Coupons**\n- You can receive coupons from leveling up, using `!daily` or by voting. There is also a small chance to get coupons from working.\n- To view your coupons, use `!coupons` and to redeem a coupon, use `!redeem`\n- Each coupon gives a random amount of money, usually around $5,000 - $20,000, but can potentially give up to $500,000\n- This is just a little extra feature and makes leveling and voting more rewarding.}

{=(r7):💸 **Giving money to other users**\nThe developers of TacoShack have thoroughly thought about this idea and have decided not to implement the ability to give money to other users.\n\n**We made this decision for 2 primary reasons:**\n#1: Users who wish to cheat could easily abuse this by making multiple accounts and channeling money to a single account. Affecting the ranking of the global leaderboards\n#2: We felt there was a small chance where users of the bot would have people give them money in real life for the bot's currency.\n\n**(If\/When)** we make an update to allow server based shacks then we would implement this...}
{=(r8):**How do I increase my hourly income?**\n• `!hire`\n• `!upgrades` aka `!up`\n• `!ads`\n• `!deco`\n\nThese have different employees you can hire, upgrades to make your shack nicer and ads to raise your visibility! All of these will contribute to your passive income.}
{=(r9):🤖 **__Invite the Bot!__**\nYou can invite the bot to a server if you have `Administrator` or `Manage Server` in [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=490707751832649738&permissions=67497024&scope=bot).\n\n**__Our Community Server__**\nWe have a Community Server you are welcome to [join](https://discord.gg/GkXJ4ud)\n\n**__Our Emoji Server__**\nSearching for a place to drop your best emotes? Head to our [emote server](https://discord.gg/rgA9kwB) to have fun!}
{=(r10):**How do I make more income?**\n• You use the `!work` & `!tip` commands to get money. You can work **every 10 minutes** & collect tips **every 5 minutes**\n• You can use `!hire` to get more employees\n• `!upgrades`  and `!decorations` to buy shack décor & more\n•  `!ads` to buy advertisements \n\n__Which will all increase your hourly income & tacos per hour__\n\n• Don't forget to `!clean` your shack daily otherwise you will get a **-25% income** or **-50% income** per hour\n• Also you can do `!daily` **every 24 hours** & **every 7 days** of your streak you get 20k or more\n\u2022 You can `!vote` / `!claim` **every 12 hours** which also gives you a reward for every 7 day streak you get\n• You can also buy temporary income boosts with `!shop`\n\n--> Don't forget you can also check your cooldowns by using `!cooldown` or `!c` for short.\n\nYou can also add things to your menu to add some extra income, use `!menu help` to view more about that.}
{=(r11):📈 **Here are the different leaderboards:**\n`!richest`, `!top`, `!lb global`, `!streak`, `!votestreak`, `!shifts <global>`, `!incomes <global>`, `!tiplb` and `!f lb` that has 4 sub-lb’s when you use the command.}
{=(r12):**How to Level Up**\nYou can gain XP by talking and using commands in **this** server (you gain 2XP for talking and 4XP for using commands). Do not spam though. \nYou can check your current level, XP and the cost of the next level using the commands `-level` in **a play channel or <#599696066505474058>**.\n\nIf you meet the requirements to level up, you can use `-levelup` in the same channel.}
{=(r13):**What are the rewards for leveling?**\nAt **Level 5** you receive: `+$100\/hr`, +5 coupons   and **<@&689954095251062850>** Role\nAt **Level 10** you receive: `+$150\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **<@&689953108138524706>** Role\nAt **Level 15** you receive: `+$200\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **<@&689953157182128140>** Role\nAt **Level 20** you receive: `+$250\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **<@&689953657277644999>** Role\nAt **Level 25** you receive: `+$400\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **<@&689953209149554726>** Role\nAt **Level 30** you receive: `+$600\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **<@&689953932239306805>** Role \n\n🧾You will also get +2 coupons for every level!}
{=(r14):❔ **How do I submit a suggestion?**\nTo submit a suggestion use `?suggest (suggestion)` in <#599696066505474058>.\n*Please use the search function on Discord to make sure your suggestion is not a duplicate.*}
{=(r15):🎰 **How to use the gamble commands:**\n`!flip [heads/tails] [bet]`\n> You can flip a coin and have a 50/50 chance of winning the amount you betted.\n\n`!slots [bet]`\n> Play slots\n\n`!scratch`\n> Buy a scratch ticket.\n\nYou can use `!help 5` to view this in your own server!}
{=(r16):**How do I use the menu?**\nTo edit your menu, you do `!menu list` to see the available items. \nThen you choose them by doing `!menu edit [number of the menu slot] [number of the item]`\n\nWhen your income increases, you unlock new menu slots which increase your hourly income.\n\n```Slot 1 at $0 income, gives +$150 income\nSlot 2 at $500 income, gives +$200 income\nSlot 3 at $1000 income, gives +$250 income\nSlot 4 at $2500 income, gives +$300 income\nSlot 5 at $5000 income, gives +$350 income\nSlot 6 at $7500 income, gives +$400 income\nSlot 7 at $10000 income, gives +$450 income\nSlot 8 at $15000 income, gives +$500 income```\nThose slots can be filled with **any item on the menu**, but each slot has an income increase set, which means **the chosen item will not affect your income.** It is just to add your favorite foods to personalize your shack!\nThere is a maximum of **8 slots**.}
{=(r17):**Max Income**\nThe way you get max income is by doing all `!upgrades`, `!hire`, `!ads`, `!deco`, expanding your shack, then getting all 8 menu slots, getting to Level 30 and being in a Level 15 franchise. \n\n**Most people who have everything maxed but level still have different incomes though. **\n\nThis is because of different versions of the bot over the past 2 years. There will be an income overhaul coming that will correct people's incomes. Currently most people are over what their max income should be.}
{=(r18):**How do the register and tip-jar channels work?**\nIn <#529044262248251422>, the customer wants to purchase tacos every **3 to 8 minutes** and the **first** person to type `sell` gets to sell their tacos and earn the money.\n\nIn <#498614068450689035>, the customer gives letters to unscramble and the **first** person to find the right word and to type it in the channel will earn the tip. \nThe words are usually food-related, so `mile` would be unscrambled to make `lime` even if mile is a word, the right answer is lime.\n\n`There is a 15 minutes slowmode in these channels to prevent one individual from taking all the tips. That way, more people have a fair chance at playing those mini-games. We do not plan to remove or reduce that cooldown.`}
{=(r19):⛔ **How to only allow the bot to work in certain channels**\nTo restrict the bot to certain channels, we use the built in permission system on Discord!\n\n1️⃣ **Make sure none of TacoShack's Role(s) give it the Administrator Permissions**\nIf a user has Administrator, all other permissions are ignored.\n\n2️⃣ **Remove Read Messages Permissions from the channels you would not like it to respond in**\nGo to the channel settings, and decline the TacoShack Bot / Role the permissions `Read Messages` in the channels you would not like it in.}
{=(r20):**What is the !s command?**\nThis command is simply for Developers to see if the bot is responding / working correctly, and sometimes used as a troubleshooting step for users. It has nothing to do with gameplay.}
{=(r21):🌮 **Tacos are simply an indicator of how much you've worked**\nSell more by doing `!work` every 10 minutes *(or less depending on donation)* or `!overtime` every 30 minutes if you're in a franchise.\nYou can compete for the `!leaderboard` and `!lb global` for most tacos sold!}
{=(r22):**Vote Issue**\n__**If you're having issues using `!claim`**__\n\n1️⃣ **Did you vote using the correct account?**\nMake sure you're logged into the correct account on top.gg and your Discord.\n\n2️⃣ **Wait up to 30 minutes**\nIf it is not instant, it can be up to 30 minutes, but *usually* will in 5 minutes.\n\n3️⃣ **Contact Support Again**\nThere may be a wider issue. You can check <#496046802722881549> for a status to see if we are aware. \n\n`Remember, you have 48 hours before your streak expires, so there is plenty of time`}
{=(r23):**Frequently Asked Questions**\nYou can read the FAQ's for the bot/server [here](https://tacoshack.dev/faq/).}
{=(r24):**Sharding**\nDue to how large discord bots can grow, it is necessary to implement a load balancing system to spread the load across multiple instances, and so the Discord Team implemented a method for this called Sharding.\n\nIt essentially splits up a bot into multiple portions and thus evens out the load.\nHowever, because of this a bot can be offline in one server but online in another.\n\nFor more detailed information please [click here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding).}
{=(r25):**Troubleshooting the bot not responding**\n__**A shard may be just rebooting, so please always wait a minute or two for it to come back online, you can use the command `!s` to check if it is online**__\n\n1️⃣ **Are you using the correct prefix?**\nThe default prefix is `!`, but it may have been changed in your server. You can use the command `!prefixinfo` to check if it has been changed (this command always responds, regardless of if it has actually changed).\n\n2️⃣ **Does the bot have the correct permissions for the channel?**\nThe bot needs the following permissions to function:\n```Read Messages\nSend Messages\nManage Messages\nEmbed Links\nRead Message History\nUse External Emotes\nAdd Reactions```\n\nPlease double check these permissions were not updated if the bot was responding before.\n\n3️⃣ **Contact Support Again**\nIf this is all correct, it is likely there is an issue with the bot. You can check <#496046802722881549> for a status to see if we are aware.}
