{=(r0):**TacoShack Beginner Guide:**\nYou can find the guide on how to get started [here.](https://tacoshack.dev/beginners-guide/)}
{=(r1):**Change Prefix:**\nTo update the bot's prefix use `!prefix newprefix`, for example `!prefix t!`. If it has the permission, the bot's nickname will be updated to show this change.\n\nYou can __always check the current prefix__ using `!prefixinfo`}
{=(r2):**How do I raise my happiness?**\nUse `!clean` once a day to keep your shack clean and your customers happy!\n(Use `!happiness` in a play channel to view more info about it)\n\n```Happiness Levels:\nHappy (-0% income): Cleaning everyday\nModerate (-25% income): Missing more than one day\nAngry (-50% income): Missing more than 5 days```}
{=(r3):**üî∫ Shack Expansion Help üî∫**\nExpand your shack to purchase more upgrades, decorations, advertisements, and hire more employees!\n\n**Shack Expansion Levels**:\n```1 - At $5,000/hr income, costs $100,000\n2 - At $10,000/hr income, costs $1,000,000\n3 - At $15,000/hr income, costs $5,000,000```\nUse `!expand` to expand your shack!}
{=(r4):**üßæ Coupons**\n- You can receive coupons from leveling up, voting or reaching a 7 day daily streak.\n- To view your coupons, use `!coupons` and to redeem a coupon, use `!redeem`\n- Each coupon gives a random amount of money, usually around $5,000 - $20,000, but can potentially give up to $500,000\n- This is just a little extra feature and makes leveling and voting more rewarding.}

{=(r7):**Giving money to other users**\n**The developers of TacoShack have thoroughly thought about this idea and have decided not to implement the ability to give money to other users.**\n\n**We made this decision for 2 primary reasons:**\n#1: Users who wish to cheat could easily abuse this by making multiple accounts and channeling money to a single account. Affecting the ranking of the global leaderboards.\n#2: We felt there was a small chance where users of the bot would have people give them money in real life for the bot's currency.\n\n**(If\/When)** we make an update to allow server based shacks then we would implement this...}
{=(r8):**How do I increase my hourly income?**\n\n‚Ä¢ `!hire`\n‚Ä¢ `!upgrades` aka `!up`\n‚Ä¢ `!ads`\n‚Ä¢ `!deco`\n\nThese have different employees you can hire, upgrades to make your shack nicer and ads to raise your visibility! All of these will contribute to your passive income.}
{=(r9):**<:tacoshack:666838731877122086> __Invite the Bot!__**\nYou can invite the bot to a server if you have `Administrator` or `Manage Server` in [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=490707751832649738&permissions=67497024&scope=bot).\n\n**__Our Community Server__**\nWe have a Community Server you are welcome to [join](https://discord.gg/GkXJ4ud)\n\n**__Our Emoji Server__**\nSearching for a place to drop your best emotes? Head to our [emote server](https://discord.gg/rgA9kwB) to have fun!}
{=(r10):**How do I make more income?**\n‚Ä¢ You use the `!work` & `!tip` commands to get money. You can work **every 10 minutes** & collect tips **every 5 minutes**\n‚Ä¢ You can use `!hire` to get more employees\n‚Ä¢ `!upgrades`  and `!decorations` to buy shack d√©cor & more\n‚Ä¢  `!ads` to buy advertisements \n\n__Which will all increase your hourly income & tacos per hour__\n\n‚Ä¢ Don't forget to `!clean` your shack daily otherwise you will get a **-25% income** or **-50% income** per hour\n‚Ä¢ Also you can do `!daily` **every 24 hours** & **every 7 days** of your streak you get 20k or more\n\u2022 You can `!vote` / `!claim` **every 12 hours** which also gives you a reward for every 7 day streak you get\n‚Ä¢ You can also buy temporary income boosts with `!shop`\n\n--> Don't forget you can also check your cooldowns by using `!cooldown` or `!c` for short.\n\nYou can also add things to your menu to add some extra income, use `!menu help` to view more about that.}
{=(r11):**Here are the different leaderboards:**\n`!richest`, `!top`, `!lb global`, `!streak`, `!shifts <global>`, `!incomes <global>`, `!incomes global` and `!f lb` that has 4 sub-lb‚Äôs when you use the command.}
{=(r12):**How to Level Up**\nYou can gain XP by talking and using commands in **this** server. Do not spam though. \nYou can check your current level, XP and the cost of the next level using the commands `-level` in **a play channel or <#599696066505474058> **.\n\nIf you meet the requirements to level up, you can use `-levelup` in the same channel.}
{=(r13):**What are the rewards for leveling?**\nAt **Level 5** you receive: `+$100\/hr`, +5 coupons   and **Part-Time Chef** Role\nAt **Level 10** you receive: `+$150\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **Full-Time Chef** Role\nAt **Level 15** you receive: `+$200\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **3 Star Chef** Role\nAt **Level 20** you receive: `+$250\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **4 Star Chef** Role\nAt **Level 25** you receive: `+$400\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **5 Star Chef** Role\nAt **Level 30** you receive: `+$600\/hr`, +5 coupons  and **Veteran Chef** Role \n\nüßæYou will also get +2 coupons for every level!}
{=(r14):**How do I submit a suggestion?**\nTo submit a suggestion use `?suggest (suggestion)` in <#599696066505474058>}
{=(r15):**How to use the gamble commands:**\n`!flip [heads/tails] [bet]`\nYou can flip a coin and have a 50/50 chance of winning the amount you betted.\n\n`!slots [bet]`\nPlay slots\n\n`!scratch`\nBuy a scratch card. Each card is $100\n\nYou can use `!help 5` to view this in your own server!}
{=(r16):**How do I use the menu?**\nTo edit your menu, you do `!menu list` to see the available items. \nThen you choose them by doing `!menu edit [number of the menu slot] [number of the item]`\n\nWhen your hourly income increases, you unlock new menu slots which increase your hourly income.\n\n```Slot 1 at $0 income, gives +$150 income\nSlot 2 at $500 income, gives +$200 income\nSlot 3 at $1000 income, gives +$250 income\nSlot 4 at $2500 income, gives +$300 income\nSlot 5 at $5000 income, gives +$350 income\nSlot 6 at $7500 income, gives +$400 income\nSlot 7 at $10000 income, gives +$450 income\nSlot 8 at $15000 income, gives +$500 income```\nThose slots can be filled with **any item on the menu**, but each slot has an income increase set, which means **the chosen item will not affect your income.** It is just to add your favorite foods to personalize your shack!\nThere is a maximum of **8 slots**.}
{=(r17):**Max Income**\nThe way you get max income is by doing all `!upgrades`, `!hire`, `!ads`, `!deco`, expanding your shack, then getting all 8 menu slots, getting to Level 30 and being in a Level 15 franchise. \n\n**Most people who have everything maxed but level still have different incomes though. **\n\nThis is because of different versions of the bot over the past 2 years. There will be an income overhaul coming that will correct people's incomes. Currently most people are over what their max income should be.}
{=(r18):**How do the register and tip-jar channels work?**\nIn <#529044262248251422>, the customer wants to purchase tacos every **3 to 8 minutes** and the **first** person to type `sell` gets to sell their tacos and earn the money.\n\nIn <#498614068450689035>, the customer gives letters to unscramble and the **first** person to find the right word and to type it in the channel will earn the tip. \nThe words are usually food-related, so `mile` would be unscrambled to make `lime` even if mile is a word, the right answer is lime.\n\n```There is a 15 minutes slowmode in these channels to prevent one individual from taking all the tips. That way, more people have a fair chance at playing those mini-games. We do not plan to remove or reduce that cooldown.```}
{=(r19):**How to only allow the bot to work in certain channels**\nTo restrict the bot to certain channels, we use the built in permission system on Discord!\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **Make sure none of TacoShack's Role(s) give it the Administrator Permissions**\nIf a user has Administrator, all other permissions are ignored.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **Remove Read Messages Permissions from the channels you would not like it to respond in**\nGo to the channel settings, and decline the TacoShack Bot / Role the permissions `Read Messages` in the channels you would not like it in.}
{=(r20):**What is the !s command?**\nThis command is simply for Developers to see if the bot is responding / working correctly, and sometimes used as a troubleshooting step for users. It has nothing to do with gameplay.}
{=(r21):**Tacos are simply an indicator of how much you've worked üåÆ**\nSell more by doing `!work` every 10 minutes *(or less depending on donation)*\nYou can compete for the `!leaderboard` and `!lb global` for most tacos sold!}
{=(r22):**Vote Issue**\n__**If you're having issues using `!claim`**__\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **Did you vote using the correct account?**\nMake sure you're logged into the correct account on top.gg and your Discord.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **Wait up to 30 minutes**\nIf it is not instant, it can be up to 30 minutes, but *usually* will in 5 minutes.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ **Contact Support Again**\nThere may be a wider issue. You can check <#496046802722881549> for a status to see if we are aware. \n\n`Remember, you have 48 hours before your streak expires, so there is plenty of time`}
{=(r23):**General Server FAQ**\nYou can read the full list of Frequently Asked Questions in the server [here.](https://tacoshack.dev/faq/)}
{=(r24):**Sharding**\nDue to how large discord bots can grow, it is necessary to implement a load balancing system to spread the load across multiple instances, and so the Discord Team implemented a method for this called Sharding.\n\nIt essentially splits up a bot into multiple portions and thus evens out the load.\nHowever, because of this a bot can be offline in one server but online in another.\n\nFor more detailed information please [click here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding).}
{=(r25):**Troubleshooting the bot not responding**\n__**A shard may be just rebooting, so please always wait a minute or two for it to come back online, you can use the command `!s` to check if it is online**__\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **Are you using the correct prefix?**\nThe default prefix is `!`, but it may have been changed in your server. You can use the command `!prefixinfo` to check if it has been changed (this command always responds, regardless of if it has actually changed).\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **Does the bot have the correct permissions for the channel?**\nThe bot needs the following permissions to function:\n```Read Messages\nSend Messages\nManage Messages\nEmbed Links\nRead Message History\nUse External Emotes\nAdd Reactions```\n\nPlease double check these permissions were not updated if the bot was responding before.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ **Contact Support Again**\nIf this is all correct, it is likely there is an issue with the bot. You can check <#496046802722881549> for a status to see if we are aware.}
