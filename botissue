{c:embed #9570D3 __Bot is Offline__ | The half of the bot is being ratelimited and cannot be used right now due to YouTube having issues causing us to spit errors enough to get ratelimited, the bot will remain down for an hour in about half of the servers to hopefully wait out the ratelimit.

__What should I do in the mean time?__
You can try to [**use Canary** (click me)](https://canary.octave.gg/), or wait it out in the mean time.}
