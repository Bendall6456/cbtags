{c:embed {i} Why did volume/bassboost/filters stop working for me? | This is recently changed to be a patreon perk which you can find as a perk on our patreon [here by clicking this blue link](https://www.patreon.com/octavebot?join). We know this sucks, and a lot of you added Octave for the sake of free volume, but unfortunately we can't both lose our growth AND be in the negatives for monthly income. Hopefully it won't always be this way, once things get more stable. But with the cost of performance for everything being free, we don't have the money to keep expanding servers for free volume to keep existing.}
